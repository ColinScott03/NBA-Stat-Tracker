# NBA Stat Tracker
The app that I created is an NBA Stat Finder app. With this app, a user can enter
the full name of an NBA player, as well as a year, past (dating back to 1980) or present,
and the app will query the BallDon'tLie API to retrieve data for the player's season
averages for the specified season, as well as the last team that this player played for.
Then, using the team information provided by the first query, the application queries the
SportsDB API to receive an image of the player's team logo and their arena.
